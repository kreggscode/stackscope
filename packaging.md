## ‚ö†Ô∏è Avoiding Suspension/Removal

### Common Reasons for Rejection

1. **Excessive Permissions**
   - ‚ùå Requesting `<all_urls>` without justification
   - ‚úÖ Use `activeTab` instead

2. **Missing Privacy Policy**
   - ‚ùå No privacy policy URL
   - ‚úÖ Host privacy policy and provide URL

3. **Deceptive Behavior**
   - ‚ùå Extension does something not described
   - ‚úÖ Clear, accurate description

4. **Data Collection Without Disclosure**
   - ‚ùå Sending data to servers without telling users
   - ‚úÖ Disclose all data collection, make it opt-in

5. **Trademark Infringement**
   - ‚ùå Using brand names in extension name/icon
   - ‚úÖ Use unique, original branding

6. **Malicious Code**
   - ‚ùå Obfuscated code, hidden functionality
   - ‚úÖ Clean, readable code

7. **Spam/Low Quality**
   - ‚ùå Duplicate functionality, poor UX
   - ‚úÖ Unique value, polished experience

### Best Practices for Compliance

#### 1. Minimal Permissions

```json
{
  "permissions": [
    "activeTab",    // ‚úÖ Only active tab
    "scripting",    // ‚úÖ Necessary for injection
    "storage"       // ‚úÖ Local storage only
  ],
  "host_permissions": []  // ‚úÖ No broad host access
}
```

**Avoid**:
- `<all_urls>`
- `tabs` (use `activeTab` instead)
- `webRequest` (unless absolutely necessary)
- `cookies` (unless absolutely necessary)

#### 2. Clear Privacy Policy

Host your privacy policy at a public URL:
- GitHub: `https://github.com/yourusername/stackscope/blob/main/privacy.md`
- Your website: `https://yourwebsite.com/stackscope/privacy`
- GitHub Pages: `https://yourusername.github.io/stackscope/privacy.html`

Include:
- What data is accessed
- How data is used
- Whether data is shared
- User rights (access, deletion)
- Contact information

#### 3. Transparent Data Handling

**If you collect ANY data**:
1. Disclose it clearly in store listing
2. Make it opt-in (not opt-out)
3. Show users exactly what will be collected
4. Provide easy way to disable
5. Allow data deletion

**For StackScope (current version)**:
- No data collection ‚Üí State this clearly
- All processing local ‚Üí Emphasize this

#### 4. Accurate Description

**Do**:
- Describe all features accurately
- Explain permissions clearly
- Set correct expectations
- Use clear, professional language

**Don't**:
- Exaggerate capabilities
- Hide functionality
- Use misleading screenshots
- Make false claims

#### 5. Quality & Polish

- Fix all bugs and console errors
- Ensure good performance
- Provide good user experience
- Include helpful documentation

#### 6. Responsive Support

- Provide valid contact email
- Respond to user reviews
