⚠️ IMPORTANT: PLACEHOLDER ICONS IN USE ⚠️

The icons in the /icons/ directory are PLACEHOLDERS and must be replaced before publishing to the Chrome Web Store.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:

1. Create or commission unique icons in these sizes:
   - icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
   - icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
   - icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

2. Replace the placeholder files in the /icons/ directory

3. Ensure your icons are:
   ✓ Original artwork (not copied)
   ✓ PNG format with transparency
   ✓ Clear and recognizable at all sizes
   ✓ Consistent style across all sizes

4. Delete this file (PLACEHOLDER_ICONS.txt) once you've replaced the icons

WHY THIS MATTERS:

- Chrome Web Store requires unique icons
- Using placeholder/generic icons may result in rejection
- Professional icons improve user trust and downloads

HOW TO CREATE ICONS:

Option 1: Use the provided icon.svg as a starting point
- Open icon.svg in a vector editor (Figma, Illustrator, Inkscape)
- Customize colors, shapes, style
- Export as PNG at required sizes

Option 2: Design from scratch
- Use design tools: Figma, Canva, Photoshop, GIMP
- Follow guidelines in /icons/README.md

Option 3: Hire a designer
- Fiverr: $5-50 for icon design
- Upwork: Professional designers
- 99designs: Design contests

TEMPORARY WORKAROUND (DEVELOPMENT ONLY):

For local testing, you can generate simple PNG placeholders:
1. Open icon.svg in a browser
2. Take screenshots at different zoom levels
3. Crop and resize to 16x16, 48x48, 128x128
4. Save as PNG files

But remember: These are for TESTING ONLY. Replace before publishing!

Once you've created your icons, delete this file and update the manifest.json if needed.
